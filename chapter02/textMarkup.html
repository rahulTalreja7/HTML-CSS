	<h1> The Story in Life </h1>
		<h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
		<p> Kurt had been staring at chicks for about an hour now. On his desk, lying between packets of <i> Malboro Lights </i>. 
		<i> with the lights out </i> and all the records of his work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite> Perfume: the 
		story of a killer </cite> It has been Kurt's <abbr title="favourite"> fav </abbr> book since college, and the longer he spent 
		in these four walls the more he smoke and take drugs and he felt he need to be free. </p>
		
		<p> He had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Kurt Cobain's quote proclaiming that 
		<q> Nobody dies virgin, life fucks all </q>. Although many considered his RockStar talents to be an outstanding achievement. 
		Kurt <em> did </em> think he had something better to do. </p>
